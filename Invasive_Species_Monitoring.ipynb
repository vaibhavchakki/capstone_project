    "**Description:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Tangles of kudzu overwhelm trees in Georgia while cane toads threaten habitats in over a dozen countries worldwide. These are just two invasive species of many which can have damaging effects on the environment, the economy, and even human health. Despite widespread impact, efforts to track the location and spread of invasive species are so costly that theyâ€™re difficult to undertake at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, ecosystem and plant distribution monitoring depends on expert knowledge. Trained scientists visit designated areas and take note of the species inhabiting them. Using such a highly qualified workforce is expensive, time inefficient, and insufficient since humans cannot cover large areas when sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because scientists cannot sample a large quantity of areas, some machine learning algorithms are used in order to predict the presence or absence of invasive species in areas that have not been sampled. The accuracy of this approach is far from optimal, but still contributes to approaches to solving ecological problems.\n",
